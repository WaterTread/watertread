## Commercial Licensing Philosophy

Commercial licensing for this project is intentionally designed to be:

- Flexible
- Accessible
- Affordable

The goal is to enable real-world deployment and experimentation without creating unnecessary financial or legal barriers.

## Licensing Models

Commercial licenses are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and may include one or more of the following models:

- Revenue-based royalties
- Fixed annual licenses
- Per-installation or per-project licenses
- Hybrid models combining royalties and fixed fees
- Optional regional or application-specific exclusivity

As a general guideline, royalty-based licenses are expected to be modest and competitive. In many cases, royalties may be capped at approximately 1% of generated revenue, depending on the scope, scale, and maturity of the deployment.

Exact terms are always agreed separately and documented in a written license agreement.
