# Front Axle Mount

## Function

The front axle mount secures the front axle to the frame and provides precise bearing support for rotational motion.
It maintains accurate alignment of the axle, gears, and tread system while minimizing friction and mechanical losses.

The front axle mount is rigidly fixed and does not allow axial movement.

## Quantity

2 pcs per system (one per side)

---

## Interfaces

- **Axle**
  - Supports the front axle shaft
  - Maintains fixed axial and radial positioning

- **Frame**
  - Mount is rigidly attached to the frame
  - Defines the fixed reference position for the front axle

- **Gear**
  - Ensures correct gear meshing and alignment under load

---

## Reference Configuration

- Typically implemented as a pillow block bearing assembly
- Bearing type and size are implementation-specific
- Prototype versions may use standard modular bearing blocks

---

## Operating Role

- Provides low-friction rotational support for the front axle
- Maintains precise gear alignment during power transmission
- Serves as the fixed anchor point for the tread system geometry

---

## Design Notes

- Front axle mount rigidity directly affects drivetrain efficiency and durability
- Bearing selection should consider submerged or splash-zone operation
- Mount geometry should allow easy installation and maintenance

---

## Implementations

- Prototype implementation:
  `models/prototype/parts/front_axle_mount/`

- Production implementation (v1.0):
