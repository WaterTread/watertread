## Function

The cam follower interfaces between the blade and the cam, translating the cam profile into controlled blade rotation.
It ensures that each blade is guided into and held in its high-drag capture orientation during the power stroke, and released for reorientation during the return phase.

Cam followers enable precise, repeatable blade motion without requiring active control or actuators.

## Interfaces

- **Blade**

  - Each blade is connected to two cam followers, one at each end
  - Provides a rotational interface allowing the blade to pivot between operating states

- **Cam**

  - The cam follower rides along the cam profile during the capture phase
  - Contact geometry determines blade orientation and timing

- **Link Tread with Connector**
  - Cam follower is mounted to the tread system via a low-friction pin connection
  - Allows free rotation while transmitting linear motion

## Operating Role

- During the **capture phase**, the cam follower engages the cam and rotates the blade into its vertical, high-drag orientation
- While engaged, the cam follower maintains blade angle against hydrodynamic loads
- During the **return phase**, the cam follower disengages from the cam, allowing the blade to rotate freely into a low-drag configuration

## Design Notes

- Cam follower mass is minimized to reduce inertial losses
- Mechanical simplicity improves reliability in submerged operation
- Passive operation ensures synchronization across all blades
