# Profitability and ROI Considerations

This document outlines a simplified approach for evaluating the economic viability of the WaterTread system.
The goal is not to provide exact financial forecasts, but to define reasonable cost boundaries based on energy production and electricity pricing.

## Key Variables

The profitability of a WaterTread installation depends on the following primary variables:

- **P** = Average electrical power output (kW)
- **H** = Annual operating hours (hours/year)
- **E** = Annual energy production (kWh/year)
- **Cₑ** = Electricity price (€/kWh or $/kWh)
- **R** = Annual revenue from electricity (€/year or $/year)
- **Cₛ** = Total system cost (including installation)
- **T** = Target payback period (years)

---

## Energy Production

Annual energy production is calculated as:

E = P × H

Example:
- Average power output: 1.5 kW
- Operating time: 6,000 hours/year

E = 1.5 × 6,000 = 9,000 kWh/year

---

## Annual Revenue

Annual revenue from electricity generation:

R = E × Cₑ

Example electricity prices:
- Low: 0.05 €/kWh (industrial / wholesale)
- Medium: 0.15 €/kWh (typical grid price)
- High: 0.30 €/kWh (remote or off-grid)

Example (0.15 €/kWh):
R = 9,000 × 0.15 = 1,350 €/year

---

## Cost Boundary Based on Payback Time

A simple and practical profitability rule:

Cₛ ≤ R × T

Where **T** is the acceptable payback period.

Typical target payback periods:
- Aggressive: 3–5 years
- Moderate: 6–10 years
- Conservative infrastructure: 10–15 years

Example (T = 8 years):
Cₛ ≤ 1,350 × 8 = 10,800 €

This means the fully installed system should cost **no more than ~10,000–11,000 €** to be economically attractive at this power level and electricity price.

## Sensitivity to Power Output

Because revenue scales linearly with power:

- Doubling average power output doubles annual revenue
- Increasing effective blade area or flow velocity has a direct economic impact
- Distributed capture (multiple blades engaged simultaneously) is economically advantageous

---

## Comparison to Other Small-Scale Hydro Systems

WaterTread targets applications where:
- Conventional turbines are inefficient or impractical
- Flow velocities are moderate but continuous
- Maintenance simplicity and debris tolerance are critical

In such environments, slightly lower peak efficiency may be acceptable if:
- Capital cost is low
- Reliability and uptime are high
- Installation is simple and modular

---

## Economic Design Implications

To remain commercially viable:
- Structural materials should be low-cost and durable
- Passive control (cams, guides) reduces operational expenses
- Container-sized systems reduce transport and installation costs
- Modular design enables incremental scaling

## Disclaimer

This document provides conceptual guidance only.
Actual profitability depends on site-specific conditions, regulatory environment, maintenance costs, and financing structure.
