# Blade Motion Cycle (Capture → Transition → Return)

Each blade follows a repeating motion cycle:

## Capture Phase
The blade is rotated into a vertical, high-drag orientation by the cam and cam follower. Hydrodynamic force acting on the blade drives the tread system forward.

## Transition Phase
As the blade exits the capture region, the cam profile releases the cam follower, allowing the blade to rotate freely.

## Return Phase
The blade is guided into a low-drag orientation by the return guide and water flow, allowing it to travel upstream with minimal resistance.

This cyclical behavior enables continuous directional motion driven purely by hydrodynamic forces.
