# Hydrodynamic Operating Principle

WaterTread converts the kinetic energy of flowing water into mechanical motion using a tread-based blade system.

Unlike conventional turbines, WaterTread distributes energy capture along a linear path. Multiple blades engage the flow simultaneously, creating a continuous force application rather than a point-based interaction.

Fixed hydrodynamic side and center panels confine the flow, preventing lateral and vertical escape and directing water through the blade capture region. This controlled channel maximizes usable hydrodynamic force while minimizing losses.

Blades alternate between a high-drag capture state and a low-drag return state, ensuring that only productive surfaces interact with the flow.
