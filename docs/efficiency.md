# System Efficiency Considerations

WaterTread efficiency depends on several interacting factors:

- Effective blade area exposed to flow
- Water velocity and density
- Blade orientation control accuracy
- Flow confinement by hydrodynamic panels
- Mechanical transmission losses

Unlike rotor-based turbines, WaterTread minimizes counterproductive drag during the return phase. Energy capture occurs along a longer interaction path, potentially increasing total extracted energy for a given flow cross-section.

System efficiency is ultimately bounded by hydrodynamic limits, but distributed capture and passive control reduce losses commonly found in rotating systems.
