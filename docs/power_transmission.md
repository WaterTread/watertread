# Power Transmission Overview

Mechanical energy captured by the blades is transferred into the tread system and delivered to the drivetrain.

Linear tread motion drives synchronized gears mounted on shared axles. These gears convert linear motion into rotation, which is then stepped up via a pinion to reach generator-compatible speeds.

The drivetrain prioritizes simplicity, low friction, and passive synchronization. Spring-loaded rear axle mounts maintain tread tension without introducing additional idler gears or parasitic losses.
