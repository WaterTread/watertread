# WaterTread

WaterTread is an open, tread-based hydrodynamic energy conversion system designed to harvest kinetic energy from flowing water using a controlled, blade-driven linear motion instead of a traditional rotating turbine.

The system is optimized for low- to moderate-flow environments and emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and containerized deployment.

## Concept Overview

Unlike conventional hydrokinetic turbines, WaterTread uses a dual-tread mechanism with actively oriented blades that engage the water flow over an extended linear capture path.

Key principles:
- Multiple blades are engaged simultaneously
- Blades operate in alternating high-drag (capture) and low-drag (return) states
- Motion is driven purely by hydrodynamic forces
- Torque delivery is smooth and continuous
- Mechanical simplicity enables modular scaling

This approach reduces return-path losses and improves blade utilization compared to point-based rotating systems.

## Key Features

- Linear tread-based energy capture (non-rotor design)
- Actively controlled blade orientation using cams and followers
- High torque output at low flow velocities
- Low-drag, protected return path
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Designed to fit within standard ISO shipping containers
- Suitable for rivers, channels, and low-head flow environments

### Commercial Use

Any commercial use — including manufacturing, deployment for power generation, or integration into commercial products — requires a separate license.

Commercial licensing is intentionally designed to be flexible, accessible, and affordable.

Royalty-based licenses are expected to be modest and competitive, often capped around approximately 1% of generated revenue, depending on project scope.
